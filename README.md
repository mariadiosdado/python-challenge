# python-challenge
Module 3 challenge
For both parts of the python challenge we completed as a group. 
Many students were having trouble so we attended office hours and contributed bits and pieces to achieving a working code.
Some people had attended tutoring one on one with a tutor but were still having trouble, thankfully together we were able 
to achieve something.

Also, for the PyPoll, every time I included the loop to print the percentages, it gave me a wrong data type error.

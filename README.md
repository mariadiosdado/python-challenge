Module 3 challenge

For both parts of the python challenge we completed as a group. 
Many students were having trouble so we attended office hours and contributed bits and pieces to achieving a working code.
Some people had attended tutoring one on one with a tutor but were still having trouble, thankfully together we were able 
to achieve something.

In the recent changes to the repository, I was able to successfully create a text file that printed the results from both PyBank and PyPoll. I also deleted files that were uploaded by mistake.
